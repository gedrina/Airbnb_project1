Airbnb is a well-known online platform that provides vacation rentals, primarily homestays and tourism experiences, to travelers around the world. It has been in operation since 2008 and is a popular choice for many travelers due to its convenience, cost-effectiveness, and ability to connect travelers with local hosts. For travelers, it is important to have a deeper understanding of Airbnb prices. In the first project of my Udacity Data Science Nanodegree, I analyzed Airbnb prices in Seattle using Seattle Airbnb data and addressed the following business questions:
1. What will be the future prices of Seattle Airbnb properties?
2. What are the prices during month/year?
3. Which property types have higher reviews, and does this impact the price?

Airbnb provides three datasets:
- A Calendar dataset showing the dates a listing was available or not and the corresponding price.
- A Listing dataset with information for each listing, including reviews, price, property type, number of reviews, etc.
- A Reviews dataset with information about reviews from guests
